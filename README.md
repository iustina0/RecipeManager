# Recipe Manager - Java Application with FXML User Interface and SQL Database Integration

The Recipe Manager is a Java project that offers an efficient and user-friendly application for managing and recommending pastry and dessert recipes. The application's graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using FXML, a declarative markup language for building JavaFX user interfaces. It also utilizes a SQL database for seamless recipe storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **Custom Recipe Creation**: The Recipe Manager allows users to create and add their own custom recipes through the FXML-based interface. Users can input recipe details, ingredients, and instructions, enhancing the recipe collection.

- **Suggest Changes to Admin**: Through the FXML UI, users can easily suggest modifications or improvements to existing recipes. The app's collaborative functionality streamlines communication between users and the administrator.

- **Suggest Recipes and Ingredients**: The FXML-based interface includes options for users to propose new recipes and ingredients. These suggestions are seamlessly integrated into the application's SQL database.

- **Rating and Collaborative System**: With the FXML UI, users can rate recipes they have tried and provide valuable feedback. The collaborative system leverages this input to recommend popular recipes to other users.

- **File Save Options in HTML Format**: Using FXML, the application allows users to save their favorite recipes in HTML format. This feature simplifies recipe storage and sharing across different platforms.

## Technical Overview

The Recipe Manager Java project utilizes JavaFX, a powerful framework for building desktop applications with rich graphical interfaces. FXML is employed to describe the application's user interface, enabling the clear separation of the presentation layer from the application logic. The project also integrates a SQL database for efficient recipe data management.

### Key Technical Components:

- **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the backend logic and managing the application's functionalities.

- **JavaFX**: The JavaFX library provides the foundation for building the GUI of the Recipe Manager application. It facilitates the creation of visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.

- **FXML**: The FXML markup language is employed to define the layout and structure of the user interface. It allows developers to design the GUI in a declarative manner, enhancing the separation of concerns in the application.

- **SQL Database**: The project utilizes a SQL database to store recipes, user suggestions, ratings, and other relevant data. SQL queries are used to interact with the database, enabling seamless data retrieval and storage.

- **User Authentication**: For security purposes, the application implements a user authentication system to control access to certain functionalities and ensure data privacy.

The Recipe Manager is an outstanding Java project that leverages FXML for building a visually appealing and interactive user interface. With SQL database integration, the application offers efficient and reliable recipe management, making it a valuable tool for culinary enthusiasts and dessert lovers alike.
